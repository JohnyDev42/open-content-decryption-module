OCDM support to Chromium is added by patching the OCDM key system into the Chromium sources.

Different patches must be applied for ClearKey and Playready DRM compatibility:

For ClearKey CDM support:

# ./patch/add_opencdm_to_chrome_key_system.patch

For Playready DRM:

# ./patch/Add_support_for_Playready_Keysystem.patch


Compatible Chromium version: 43.0.2357.81
